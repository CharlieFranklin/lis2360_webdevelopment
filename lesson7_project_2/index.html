      <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
      <h4>What is Discord?</h4>
      <p>
      Discord is taking over the video game/Esport community. But what even is Discord? some of you might ask. Discord is a free to download application that you can get on any device whether it be IPhone, Andriod, PC, and Mac. Discord is a place where you can get all of your friends or family into one place no matter how far they are. It works just like skype does, where you can talk with people from around the world in one chat together, You can have a group chat, a chat for a few people or even just a nice chat for yourself where you can play music, play games, or do a wide variety of different things. Discord is basically the next step up from skype.
      </p>
      <h4>What's Their Purpose?</h4>
      <p>
      The main purpose behind Discord is to bring a group of friends together to play video games. <br>
      When creating a server, you now have the opportunity to make a group of friends online and chat with them in one group or server, all you have to do is send those people a code for your server and they just enter it in and BOOM, it's set. Now this whole idea might sound silly to some people, but discord has accumulated over 150 <b>million</b> people across the globe to download and play on their application.
      </p>
      <h4>Why Should you Download it?</h4>
      <p>
      If you have a group of people or person that you used to talk to on a daily basis but not so much now because you either moved away, they moved away, someones gone a seperate path, something like that. You should definitely hit them up and tell them to download discord so you can catch up with those people. Discord allows so many people to keep in touch even though they are miles away from each other. I constantly log in to discord to talk with my friends and play video games with them on a daily basis. But that's the thing, without Discord, I dont know where I would be right now. Whether it be talking to a whole different group of new friends, going to a different college, or even not communicating with my friends at all. Discord has made my life easier because I can talk with all my homies and roast them from time to time. Discord makes me happy and I'd recommend it to anyone I see.
      </p>
      <h4>What are some features in Discord?</h4>
      <p>
      Aside from just talking to your friends or family on Discord, you can do a lot of other activities. <br>
      Discord has over 100 bots coded for the program. Bots that has different purposes, for example there is a bot called Ayana and Ayana's main purpose is to play music, so while you're in Discord, to activate it all you have to do is type "=music p (enter song name here)" and it will play any song you wish. They alos have well known bots such as akinator which was a popular IOS app that guesses any person you are thinking of. One last example is a bot called "Poke&#769cord" Which is just a pokemon generator that "spawns" pokemon in your discord chat for you to vatch and collect. Every bot is very unique and has its own purpose.
      </p>

          <p>
      Discord described themselves very well in my opinion, simply stating that they are <q><em><strong>All-in-one voice and text chat for gamers that's free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone. Stop paying for TeamSpeak servers and hassling with Skype. Simplify your life.</strong></em></q>
